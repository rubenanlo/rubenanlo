## Introduction 🤓

I am a full stack web developer with a special focus on NextJs, Tailwind and material UI. Prior to becoming a web developer in 2022, I worked as a consultant in big organizations. My previous experience allows me to make the link between the business and the development of web applications, which helps in improving the user experience and aligning my work with the focus of business. 

Curious by nature and avid learner. I am looking for the next step in my career and ready to apply my technical and soft skills to a job related to web development.
