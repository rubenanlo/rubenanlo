### Ruben Andino

## Introduction

After over 10 years of supporting multinational enterprises to determine the appropriate pricing between their related entities, I am becoming a full stack web developer with knowledge on HTML, CSS, Javascript, react, mongodb, among other related tools. Curious by nature and avid long time learner. I am looking for the next step in my career and ready to apply my technical and soft skills to a job that really matters.
